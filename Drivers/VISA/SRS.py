        value which controls the frequency of the 10 MHz ovenized oscillator.
        
        Normally, this value is controlled by the FLL control algorithm,
        however, the FLL may be stopped, and the value adjusted manually (See
        the LO command.) Two 12-bit DACs are scaled (by 1000:1) and summed to
        provide a varactor voltage which controls the frequency of the 10 MHz
        oscillator. The low DAC, which operates over half its range (to avoid
        FFL oscillations at the roll-over to the high DAC) provides a LSB
        frequency resolution of 1.5:10^-12. The high DAC, which has a nominal
        value of 2048, has a LBS resolution of 1.5:10^-9. These DACs provide a
        total tuning range of about Â±3 ppm.
        
        Both DACs may be set to any value in the range specified above. 
        However, it is possible to set the frequency of the 10 MHz oscillator
        so far from the correct frequency that the FLL signal disappears,
        making the lock impossible. If this happens, the last saved FC value
        may be read from EEPROM with the FC!? command and restored with the
        FC{high,low} command. 
        
        The FC! command is used to save the current FC values in the unitâs
        EEPROM. The FC!? Command may be used to read the value which is stored
        in the EEPROM. The value stored in EEPROM is used to set the 10 MHz at
        startup, before the FLL can be established. Occasionally while the unit
        is operating (at about 20 minutes after power-on and once a day there
        after) the program will write a new value to EEPROM to correct the
        value for crystal aging.

            2021,1654 (Tracking the FC value over a long period of time tells
            you about the frequency variations of the 10MHz crystal. The FC
            values will change to correct for variations in the crystal
            frequency due to aging and ambient conditions.)
        Example:
            FC 2048,2048
            will set the 10MHz oscillator back to the middle of its tuning
            range.

        The first number, the amplitude of the signal at Ïmod, is the error
        signal in the rubidium frequency lock loop. The value is proportional
        to the instantaneous frequency error of the 10 MHz oscillator as
        detected by the physics package. The value may be large when the unit
        is first locking, and will bobble around zero in steady state. Each LSB
        corresponds to about 15 ÂµVrms of signal at Ïmod.
        
        The second number is the amplitude (in millivolts rms) of the

        photo-signal at the modulation frequency (70 Hz) as the error signal
        for the FLL. The phase between modulation source and the error signal
        is affected by phase shifts in the modulation and signal filters and 
        by optical pumping time constants. This parameter corrects for the
        accumulation of all of these phase shifts. Each modulation cycle 
        consists of 32 phase slots, so each phase increment corresponds to
        11.25Â°. 
        
        The PH! command is used to write the current phase parameter into the
        unitâs EEPROM. This is a factory only command. The value which is
        burned in EEPROM is used on power-on and restart, and may be queried by
        the PH!? command.

        be calibrated by magnetic field adjustment.
        
        The SP! command is used to write the current frequency synthesizer
        parameters to the unitâs EEPROM for use after the nest restart or

        A frequency synthesizer, which uses the 10 MHz OCXO as a frequency
        reference, is used to generate the RF which sweeps the rubidium 
        hyperfine transition. The frequency synthesizer multiplies the 10 MHz
        by a factor M = 19 * (64*N + A) / R, to generate a frequency near
        6.834 GHz. (The factor of 19 is from frequency multiplication in the 
        step recovery diode, and the other terms come from the operation of the
        dual modulus frequency synthesizer integrated circuit.) The apparent
        transition frequency is different for each physics package, due mostly
        to variations in the fill pressure of the resonance cell. The frequency
        synthesizer parameters, R, N and A, are used to adjust the frequency
        synthesizerâs output frequency to the closest frequency just above the
        apparent transition frequency, then the magnetic field is set to move
        the transition frequency up to the synthesizer frequency. During 
        frequency locking, the frequency of the 10 MHz OCXO is adjusted to
        maintain the output of the frequency synthesizer on the rubidium
        hyperfine transition frequency. Initial calibration of the unit will
        involve finding the synthesizer parameters and magnetic field value
        which will lock the 10 MHz OCXO at exactly 10 MHz.
        
        During the lifetime of the unit, there will be some aging of the
        physics package, which will cause the apparent transition frequency to
        change. This is usually corrected by minor calibration adjustments of
        the magnetic field strength, which provides a setting resolution of a
        few parts in 10^-12. (See the MO command.) However, if the magnetic
        field strength reaches its lower or upper limit, it is necessary to
        change the frequency synthesizer parameters, which can change the
        output frequency in steps of about one part in 10^-9. The table in
        Appendix A (of the PRS10 user's manual) details the values for R, N and A
        for the range of frequencies needed.

        Example:
            During calibration, a unitâs 10 MHz output frequency is found to
            be low by 0.010 Hz, and the magnetic field offset adjustment is
            already at its maximum. (See the MO command.) Sending the SP?
            command returns the current values of R, N and A which are 
            2610,1466,63 in this example. This corresponds to line 38 in the
            table in Appendix A (of the PRS10 user's manual). To increase the
            frequency of the 10 MHz output, we select the next higher setting,
            line 37, which will increase the frequency by 0.01986 Hz. To do
            this, we send the command SP 5363,3014,22 (which are the parameters
            from line 37). Waiting for the frequency to settle, we now measure
            the output to be about 0.0098 Hz high. Now the magnetic field is
            adjusted down to calibrate the unit to exactly 10 MHz. (The SP!
            command is used to save these new values in EEPROM for the next
            power-on or restart. Also see the MO command for adjusting the

        The MO? command reads back the current value of the magnetic offset.
        
        MO! is used to store the current value of the magnetic offset parameter
        to EEPROM for use after the next restart.
        
        MO!? may be used to query the value stored in EEPROM. This value is
        used on power-up or restarts.

        A magnetic field coil inside the resonance cell is used to tune the
        apparent hyperfine transition frequency. The magnetic field is
        controlled by a 12-bit DAC. Increasing the magnetic field will increase
        the hyperfine transition frequency, which will increase the frequency
        of the 10 MHz output. The transition frequency may be tuned over about
        Â±3 x 10^-9 by the magnetic field, which corresponds to Â±0.030 Hz at
        10 MHz. The output frequency (at 10 MHz) tunes quadratically with field
        strength, and âf(Hz) â 0.08 * (DAC/4096)^2. A minimum magnetic field
        should always be present to avoid locking to the wrong Zeeman component
        of the hyperfine transition, so the 12-bit DAC may be set from 1000 to
        4095 with 3000 being the nominal midscale value. (A DAC value of 1000
        corresponds to about 6% of the full-scale frequency tuning range, 3000
        corresponds to about 53%, while 4095 is 100% of the full-scale range.)
        
        To help cancel frequency shifts due to external magnetic fields, the
        current in the coil is switched at a 5 Hz rate. The frequency lock-loop
        averages over a full period of the switch rate to avoid injecting a
        spur at 5 Hz onto the 10 MHz control signal. The switching of the 
        magnetic field is enabled at power-on and restart, but may be turned
        on or off by RS-232 command. (see MS command.)
        
        The commands associated with magnetic field control (MO, MS, and MR)
        allow direct control of the magnetic field circuitry. Most users will
        not want to control the magnetic field directly, but will instead
        allow the program to read the frequency calibration pot or external 
        control voltage and then control the magnetic field. If they want
        software control of the unitâs calibration, they may choose to use the
        SF commands, which disable the analog control and allow the frequency
        to be adjusted over a range of Â±2000x10^-12. (The program will linearize
        the magnetic field control of the frequency offset with either analog
        or software control.)

            reference for a very long time (several periods of Ïn) when the 
            1pps reference input makes an abrupt shift of +100ns (moving later
            in time). The PRS10âs 1pps PLL algorithm will reduce the PRS10âs
            frequency of operation (by adjusting its SF parameter) to eliminate
            the 100ns phase shift between the 1pps reference input and the 1pps
            output. After the phase shift is eliminated, the PRS10 will settle
            to the âcorrectâ operating frequency. The PLL algorithm computes
            integral and proportional terms from time-tag measurements, 
            adjusting the SF parameter to phase lock the 1pps output to the
            1pps input. The table below shows the integral and proportional
            gain terms. For the nominal PT value of 8, the integral term is
            -0.055 SF bits per hour per ns of time-tag and the proportional
            gain is -0.25 SF bits per ns of time-tag. Per the table below for
            PT 8, if the input reference shifts by +100ns, the proportional
            term will adjust the SF by -0.25bits/ns * 100ns = -25 bits. Each SF
            bit corresponds to 1:10^-12 of the operating frequency, and so the
            PRS10 frequency will be shifted by about -25 x 10^-12. The integral
            term will begin ramping by (-0.055bits/hour/ns) * 100ns, or by -5.5
            bits per hour. The phase shift between the 1pps input and 1pps
            output will be gradually eliminated. (Phase jumps of 100ns are
            quite common on 1pps outputs from GPS receivers, which are a likely
            1pps reference to the PRS10. The corresponding frequency jumps of
            25 x 10^-12 may be excessive in some applications, and so a digital
            pre-filter is used to smooth the time-tag values before they are
            used by the PLL algorithm. See LM command.)
